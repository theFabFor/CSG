                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 text-left">
                    <div class="aboutOne">
                        <p>Colorado Sweet Gold's 21st century mission is to invest in appropriate uses of our facilities to provide core resources for our regional partners. We are fortunate to be located in the dynamic North Colorado economic region where vast new oil and natural gas reserves are driving the local economy to previously unheard of levels.</p>
                        <p>CSG Industrial Park resides at the former Great Western Sugar company's Johnstown facility and has been able to repurpose some of their original infrastructure, particularly the railyard. Much of the original infrastructure, outdated and worn, has been recycled. What has been preserved is the foundation for our vision of this historic property in today's Johnstown Colorado.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 text-left">
                    <div class="aboutTwo">
                        <p>We understand the importance of sustainability and how devastating it can be to a region when outside forces cause the collapse of entire business sectors, much as what became of the midwest's sugar beet industry. With that in mind we have developed a plan for this property that is diverse, takes into account the needs of the local community, and puts back to work a significant portion of the property.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 20% of the land has been annexed into Johnston and, in coordination with local planners, is being developed into new residential and commercial neighborhoods. With a focus on easy access to the new city center and proximity to the proposed nature trail connecting Johnstown to nearby Milliken we hope this development appeals to Coloradans who enjoy the conveniences that a town the size of Johnstown provides while still being in touch with the region's natural beauty.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 text-left">
                    <div class="aboutThree">
                        <p>The remaining 80% of the property is presently used for a variety of purposes, from supporting our vibrant oil industry via a transloading facility and oil storage tank farm to grain elevators, heated warehousing, water storage facilities, small business operating centers, a certified scalehouse, and more. In addition over 50 acres are in production as irrigated farm land. The north east corner houses Johnstown's electrical sub-station, providing reliable cost effective energy to the town.</p>
                        <p>We would like to believe we're earning a place in the community by bringing back to life a property that might just as easily become the permanent victim of disuse and decay. Along the way in the midst of the hard work of building sustainable businesses, new aquaintenances will be made, challenges will be met, loss will be mourned, and success will be celebrated. We're prepared for all of those outcomes. If our business sense and offerings are of interest give us a call. North Colorado is ready.</p>
